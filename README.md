Hello and welcome to the Computer Science Club's Spring 2019 project! 

Each of you has been assigned a task that you can view here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t-LP74rc4Cb3FGGQ_dNucH8P1wZABYSJn35-6Eegefs/edit?usp=sharing

Please be running on this version of Unity: https://download.unity3d.com/download_unity/eb4bc6fa7f1d/UnityDownloadAssistant-2017.4.22f1.exe 

When tackling your project, you will be expected to make a new branch and do your work on that branch. When you are done with your project, you can feel free to make a pull request. When the request is seen, your work will be evaluated and then added to the game. 

Thank you, and good luck! I know you will all do great!
